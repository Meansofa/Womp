            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tracing the History of Computing, I learnt a lot of interesting facts and knowledge, as well as the difficulties on achieving the major milestones and the development of inventions that have brought us to this point of revolutionized world of technology.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The origins of computing started around 3000 BC, there emerged the earliest form of a calculating device, the Chinese Abacus. A Mathematician and Scientist <a href="Inventors.html">Blaise Pascal</a>, built the first mechanical calculator, the complexity of this device drove the first sign of fear and discomfort towards advanced technology. <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onwards we meet who is considered to be the first computer scientist, <a href="Inventors.html">Gottfried Leibniz</a>, invented the first calculating machine that was able to perform arithmetic operations, and provided the concept of binary arithmetic.<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="Inventors.html">Charles Babbage</a> notably known as the “Father of the Computer”, using steam power he invented the difference engine, and the analytical engine, which stores memory and reads instructions, making it a programmable mechanical computer, it&apos;s algorithm was designed by <a href="Inventors.html">Ada Lovelace</a>, the first programmer who worked alongside Charles Babbage.<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The company IBM, founded by <a href="Inventors.html">Herman Hollerith</a>, inventor of the Census Tabulator, an electromechanical machine inspired by the analytical engine, that reads census data from punch cards and tallying up the result notably quick, to input data to a punch card they used a keypunch machine, the first iteration of what we&apos;ve come to known today as the keyboard.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first programmable computer by <a href="Inventors.html">Konrad Zuse</a>, can use boolean logic that passes true or false output using relays. Relays were soon then replaced with vacuum tubes which were a huge improvement, as it consumes less power, it&apos;s much faster and more reliable.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From this point on, we can already see the substantial leap the history of computing had evolved, from seemingly mechanical based computing, to using electromagnetic relays to pass information, to digital vacuum tubes that controls the flow of electrons.<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The transition to electronic computing accelerated in the development of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer aka <a href="Inventors.html">ENIAC</a> which scaled a ton of 28 cubic meters, along with its successor, the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer aka <a href="Inventors.html">EDVAC</a>, the first stored program computer.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The vacuum tube will soon be replaced with a silicon transistor, which was invented in <a href="Inventors.html">Bells Lab</a> in 1947, and in 1954, the first Transistorized Digital Computer aka <a href="Inventors.html">TRADIC</a>, was composed of 800 transistors and only scaled by .085 cubic meters. It has low power consumption, can perform a million operations per second and has the same function as the vacuum tube.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Random Access Magnetic Core Store or what we know today as RAM was introduced as the first memory device in 1951  by <a href="Inventors.html">Jay Forrester</a>. The company IBM also invented the first harddrive which computer memory is stored permanently and could store approximately five megabytes.<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assembly was the first computer language that existed in 1949, it communicates via pseudocode instead of using binary, IBM also invented a widely iterated programming language Fortran, Fortran is a high-level language compared to Assembly, which requires a deep understanding in computer architecture. <a href="Inventors.html">Grace Hopper</a>, inventor of the word “debugging” and  the first computer compiler, allowed to write programs in higher-level languages.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An invention in 1958, that solves the problem of complexity in connectors from using transistors. It packed multiple transistors onto a single chip, as well as reducing faulty wires, and minimizing heat consumption on computers. This innovation sparked a hardware revolution. During this time, inventions like the computer mouse, the floppy disk, and DRAM from the company Intel emerged. Additionally, it led to the proliferation of programming languages, including BASIC in 1964 and C in 1971.<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1965, <a href="Inventors.html">Gordon Moore</a>, a co-founder of Intel, formulated a prediction regarding computing. He proposed that computing power would double every two years, a theory that became renowned as "Moore's Law", the chronicle of progress in the computer industry.<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From decades to several centuries, inventors, Scientists and Engineers, had brought many discoveries that contributed to the evolution of computing technology. The amount of commitment in their studies have brought ideas that became the fortitude for the modern technology we have today.<br>
